# Open Learning Knowledge Base

## Outline

A learning and development repository, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository is somewhat of a "personal wiki". 
It contains knowledge and information that has been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and experiences of the author.

## Purpose

## Intended Audience

## Structure

This open knowledge collection is ordered by categories. Each of these categories contains 
some of the following resources: 

- **A collection of Patterns:**  
- **Articles and short form information:** These sections contain a list of articles that were written by either myself or others and added with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, or specific case-studies.
- **Resources and Reviews :** 

A set of concepts and common abbreviations can be found in the [glossary](/_glossary).

### Patterns

For consistency, the patterns follow a similar structure.
As we all know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of 
when it can be useful to consider using it. The aim is not to apply as many of them as you can on any given task.
**This is not a bingo chart.**

## Why learn about learning? 

Over the ages, a lot of research has been done on just how people are able to learn and acquire new skills. As humans, we often feel a need to know how good we are at something, and how to become better. In the following sections, we will go over a few of the more useful conceptual models on the stages of mastery.
In the modern knowledge-based economy, being apt at learning new skills and concepts is a signipicant competitive advantage.

## Meta-Learning

Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized". Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of his theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to facilitate meta learning. Learners must:

- have a theory,however primitive
- work in a safe supportive social and physical environment
- discover their rules and assumptions
- reconnect with reality-information from the environment
- reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions.

## Patterns Overview

For consistency, the patterns follow a similar structure.
As we all know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of 
when it can be useful to consider using it. The aim is not to apply as many of them as you can on any given task.
**This is not a bingo chart.**

The pattern section is followed by a series of **articles** that were written in the past by myself, 
or others. If I do not hold the copyright of the material included here, it will be mentioned and the 
original author will be asked for approval before the content is included here.

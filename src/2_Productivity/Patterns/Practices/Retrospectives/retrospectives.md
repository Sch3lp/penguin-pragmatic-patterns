> A retrospective, generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past.

Hosting a useful retrospective session is quite difficult. You aim to have a group share their frustrations, obstacles, and 
share knowledge about what went well. One of the risks of having a static retro format, are that teams lose interest in the sessions, and are less engaged during the meeting.
We aim to avoid this staleness by varying the "theme" of the retro, while keeping the general structure the same.

Every group can employ slight variations on the approach used, based on a similar template. The aim of these alternating retro formats is to stimulate constructive communication between team members.While the team lead or management are present during the discussions, and have the final decision on actions proposed, they should refrain from taking an authoritative position during the retro.

## Applicable Context

Helping a team or project being in a rut, going through the motions without engaging or following-up on issues and frustrations. Successful application of this practice highly depends on:
- Team/Management is willing to try, and dedicate time to improve their process 
- Trust in the intentions and skills of the facilitator or person taking the initiative 
- Team members feel safe to share their opinions without fear of reprisals

Do not use when:
- The group has no motivation to experiment with alternative ways of working
- You are operating in a low trust, high conflict environment
- You can not invest the time to be a driving force of change
